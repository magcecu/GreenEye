# GreenEye
GreenEye is a simple yet effective antimalware software. It works by spectating different folders for abnormal activity and when it detects something it will print a message into the console. You can do various things with the newly appeared files such as: 
-Delete them on the spot for any simple flooding malwares
-Turn off your PC when it sences such activity
-Look for unwanted webcam activity

## Usage
ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS!

This software is ment for turning on only when opening weird files, links etc. because it will cause a bit of unwanted traffic or the CPU. If it detects some activity thats not caused by you its best to turn off your computer if you dont have that already enabled. When turned off boot into safeboot and check everything - startup folder, place for recent activities etc.
This is a good way for detecting trojans and keyloggers.
Dont forget to install the requierments!
